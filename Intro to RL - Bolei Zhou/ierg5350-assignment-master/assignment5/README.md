**We will hold a tournament for all submitted agents. Any overdue submission will lose the opportunity to join the tournament (and the credits with that).**

Please find instruction at the `IERG 5350 Assignment 5.ipynb`. We don't make constraint on the platform you will use to implement and train your agent. You can design and improve your agent (1) locally, (2) in Colab, or even (3) implement locally and train in Colab.

Good luck!
