    "## Section 4: Implement Deep Q Learning in Pytorch\n",
    "\n",
    "(50 / 100 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, you will get familiar with the basic logic of pytorch, which lay the ground for further learning. We will implement a MLP similar to the one in Section 3 using Pytorch, a powerful Deep Learning framework. Before start, you need to make sure using `pip install torch` to install it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are not familiar with Pytorch, we suggest you to go through pytorch official quickstart tutorials:\n",
    "1. [quickstart](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html)\n",
    "2. [tutorial on RL](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "Different from the algorithm in Section 3, we will implement Deep Q Network (DQN) in this section. The main differences are concluded as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN requires an experience replay memory to store the transitions.** A replay memory is implemented in the following `ExperienceReplayMemory` class. It can contain a certain amount of transitions: `(s_t, a_t, r_t, s_t+1, done_t)`. When the memory is full, the earliest transition is discarded to store the latest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction of replay memory increase the sample efficiency (since each transition might be used multiple times) when solving complex task, though you may find it learn slowly in this assignment since the CartPole-v0 is a relatively easy environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN is an off-policy algorithm and has difference when computing TD error, compared to Sarsa.** In Sarsa, the TD error is computed as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(r_t + \\gamma Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t))$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "wherein the next action $a_{t+1}$ is the one the policy selects. However, in traditional Q learning, it assume the next action is the one that maximizes the action values and use this assumption to compute the TD: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$(r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a_{t+1}} Q(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**DQN has make delayed update target network, which is another difference even compared to the traditional Q learning.** DQN maintains another neural network called target network that has identical structure of the Q network. After a certain amount of steps has been taken, the target network copies the parameters of the Q network to itself. Normally, the update of target network is much less frequent than the update of the Q network. The Q network is updated in each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason to leverage the target network is to stabilize the estimation of TD error. In DQN, the TD error is evaluated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$(r_t + \\gamma \\max_{a_{t+1}} Q^{target}(s_{t+1}, a_{t+1}) - Q(s_t, a_t))$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Q values of next state is estimated by the target network, not the Q network that is updating. This mechanism can reduce the variance of gradient because the estimation of Q values of next states is not influenced by the update of the Q network.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the engineering aspect, the differences between `DQNTrainer` and the previous `MLPTrainer` are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. DQN uses pytorch model to serve as the approximator. So we need to rewrite the `initialize_parameter` function to build the pytorch model. Also the `train` function is changed since the gradient optimization is conducted by pytorch, therefore we need to write the pytorch pipeline in `train`.\n",
    "2. DQN has replay memory. So we need to initialize it, feed data into it and take the transitions out.\n",
    "3. Thank to the replay memory and pytorch, DQN can be updated in a batch. So you need to carefully compute the Q target via matrix computation.\n",
    "4. We use Adam optimizer to conduct the gradient optimization. You need to get familiar with how to compute the loss and conduct backward propagation.\n"
