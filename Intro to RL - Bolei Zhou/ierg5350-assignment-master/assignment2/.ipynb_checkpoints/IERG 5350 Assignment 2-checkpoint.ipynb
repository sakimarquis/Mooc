    "\n",
    " - Section 1: Implementation of model-free familiy of algorithms: SARSA, Q-Learning and model-free control. (100 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to go through this self-contained notebook, which contains dozens of **TODOs** in part of the cells and has special `[TODO]` signs. You need to finish all TODOs. Some of them may be easy such as uncommenting a line, some of them may be difficult such as implementing a function. You can find them by searching the `[TODO]` symbol. However, we suggest you to go through the documents step by step, which will give you a better sense of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are encouraged to add more code on extra cells at the end of the each section to investigate the problems you think interesting. At the end of the file, we left a place for you to optionaly write comments (Yes, please give us some either negative or positive rewards so we can keep improving the assignment!). \n",

    "You have noticed that in Assignment 1 - Section 2, we always use the function `trainer._get_transitions()` to get the transition dynamics of the environment, while never call `trainer.env.step()` to really interact with the environment. We need to access the internal feature of the environment or have somebody implement `_get_transitions` for us. However, this is not feasible in many cases, especially in some real-world cases like autonomous driving where the transition dynamics is unknown or does not explicitly exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will introduce the Model-free family of algorithms that do not require to know the transitions: they only get information from `env.step(action)`, that collect information by interacting with the environment rather than grab the oracle of the transition dynamics of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will continue to use the `TabularRLTrainerAbstract` class to implement algorithms, but remember you should not call `trainer._get_transitions()` anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use a simpler environment `FrozenLakerNotSlippery-v0` to conduct experiments, which has a `4 X 4` grids and is deterministic. This is because, in a model-free setting, it's extremely hard for a random agent to achieve the goal for the first time. To reduce the time of experiments, we choose to use a simpler environment. In the bonus section, you will have the chance to try model-free RL on `FrozenLake8x8-v0` to see what will happen. \n",

Concretely, we maintain a batch of lists (the total number of lists is `obs_dim * action_dim`), each elememnt of the batch is a list correspondent to a state-action pair. The list is used to store the previously happenning \"return\" of each state action pair.\n",
