# Example for multi-armed bandits

Several standard algorithms for solving the multi-armed badits problem:

* epsilon-greedy
* softmax
* UCB1
* UCB2
* Hedge

refer to [algorithms/randomselect.py](algorithms/randomselect.py) for the API of the algorithm. 

* Run the simulation
```
    python simulation.py
```
