##  RL algorithms in practice

* Classic reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented in [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/metalbubble/DeepRL-Tutorials). A good reading for understanding algorithms.

* High-quality reinforcement learning [baselines](https://github.com/openai/baselines) implemented by OpenAI
