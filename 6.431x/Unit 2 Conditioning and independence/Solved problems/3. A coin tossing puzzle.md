**A coin tossing puzzle.** A coin is tossed twice. Alice claims that the event of getting two Heads is at least as likely if we know that the first toss is Heads than if we know that at least one of the tosses is Heads. Is she right? Does it make a difference if the coin is fair or unfair? How can we generalize Alice's reasoning?
