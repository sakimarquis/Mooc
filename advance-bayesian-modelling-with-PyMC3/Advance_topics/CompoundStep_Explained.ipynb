    "A recurrent issue/concern is the validately of mixing discrete and continuous sampling, especially mixing other sampler with NUTS. While in BDA 3rd edition Chapter 12.4 there is a small paragraph on this \"Combining HMC with Gibbs sampling\", which suggesting this could be a valid way to do, the Stan devs always skeptical about how practical it is ([1](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/mcmc-sampling-does-not-work-when-execute/1918/47), [2](http://discourse.mc-stan.org/t/constraining-latent-factor-model-baysian-probabalisic-matrix-factorization-to-remove-multimodality/2152/21)). \n",

    "The concern with mixing discrete and continuous sampling is that the change in discrete parameters will affect the continuous distribution's geometry so that the adaptation (i.e., the tuned mass matrix and step size) may be inappropriate. HMC/NUTS is hypersensitive to its tuning parameters (mass matrix and step size). We also don't know how many iterations we have to run to get a decent sample when the discrete parameters change. We haven't evaluated any of this, in my experience if the discrete parameter is low dimension (e.g., 2 class mixture equivalent, outliner detection with explicit discrete labelling) it works OK. However, it is much less efficient than marginalize out the discrete parameters, and you do see the chain being stuck quite often.\n",
    "It would be good to evaluate this more properly, eg to simulate data and look at posterior coverage, as explained in [Cook, Gelman, and Rubin 2006](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1198/106186006x136976)."
