# Advance Bayesian Modelling with PyMC3

This repository contains notebooks, slides, and videos for my workshop in May 2018 @CEAi in the Czech Republic.

### Background preparation 
The attendees had work through [Introduction to Probabilistic programming (with PyMC3)](https://github.com/junpenglao/PrecisionWorkshop1_Prep), which is built on top of the tutorials by Chris Fonnesbeck.
Basic knowledge of scientific computation in Python and PyMC3 is required.
